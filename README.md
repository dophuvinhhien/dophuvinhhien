👋 Hi, I’m Đỗ Phú Vinh Hiển  
- 👀 I'm interested in learning new things, looking at cute pictures, watching funny videos, shopping, and fashion. I also want to become a better version of myself every day.  
- 🌱 I'm currently studying Computer Science at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology. My major is Data, Security Engineering, and Business Intelligence.  
  I know the name might sound a bit unclear, but in essence, I focus on learning how to improve user experience, analyze context and requirements, and ensure solutions align with client needs.  
  Of course, I also implement and code these solutions to meet specific objectives.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Back-end or Full-Stack Development projects.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Email – vinhhien050904@gmail.com | Facebook – https://www.facebook.com/dophuvinhhien
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm usually very quiet when I first meet someone. But once we get to know each other, I'm super friendly and open!😄
